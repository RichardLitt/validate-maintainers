# Validate Maintainers

> Validate your npm package maintainers to limit your bus factor

This package validates a `localMaintainers` field which you can set to match the npm-set `maintainers` field. This makes it easier to limit your bus-factor for npm packages, by making sure that you have more than one person who can publish to an npm package.

## Background

TODO

## Install

```sh
npm install --global validate-maintainers
```

For now, this is only a CLI tool.

## Usage

```sh
Usage
  $ validate-maintainers <input>

Options
  --local, -l Compare a local package.json to the one in the registry
  --dist      Print distribution tags from npm (eg: npm info <pkg> dist-tags)
  --versions  Print versions from npm (eg: npm info <pkg> versions)

Examples
  $ validate-maintainers orbit-db
  There are no manually-specified npm maintainers for 0.19.9.

  # To set a verison, use <pkg@version>
  $ validate-maintainers validate-maintainers@latest
  Version: latest
  Everybody wins!
  The npm-set maintainers match the manually-set maintainers exactly.
  The current maintainers for validate-maintainers@latest:
    - richardlitt
```

### How to set new maintainers

Validate Maintainers will _not_ set your maintainers for your repository. You need to do this manually. To add someone as a maintainer for an npm package, take a look at `npm owner --help`. As well, to set the local maintainers, add a `localMaintainers` field in your package.json and add anyone who should have *publishing* rights to your repository. This is different from the `authors` and `maintainers` field in your `package.json`, which doesn't perfectly line up with actual users who have publishing rights.
